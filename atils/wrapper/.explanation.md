In the context of how atils does its job, these are wrappers. What they do is wrap around and bind together components specialized toward different tasks. Think of them like a spiderweb, one that has ensnared many insects that dance to discordant rhythms. The wrapper then, in addition to being the web, is also the spider at its heart, twisting and yanking on the cords it has built between the dancers, moving them to a larger symphony.
