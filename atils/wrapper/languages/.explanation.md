In the context of wrappers that bind together disparate dancing bugs, the languages section are those wriggling things that tug at the strings that move the mechanisms of programming. Each program is written in a certain, chosen language, and these folders contain the tools that enable you to efficiently write code in that language. This will also include templates for projects started up in that language, for a certain purpose. However, an effort will be made to fit a language or tooling very tightly to its purpose, so that there should only be two or three types of templates in a language. If more are needed, you need to either revisit that paradigm and come up with tools to simplify it, or split out unaligned project types into new languages.
