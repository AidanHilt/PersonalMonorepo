In the context of the insects in the great web that, that yank and writhe at the mechanisms of languages, this folder holds the wheels, the gears, the sprockets, all the rest. These respond, in a delicate dance to the hand of the programmer, gyrating about the mechanisms, a push here, pull there, pirouette of the middle fingers. This is the stuff that directly touches the tools you use every day, so treat it with care. Be flexible up there, at the level of the wrapper, but down here? These are the bones of your whole operation, and you best heed what gets done in here.
