# The Mono-FLake
Eventually, I'll write up some documentation on how and why this thing works the way it does. I'll even try to make it witty. But in the meantime, here's some setup directions

## Nixos Setup
Instructions for using the bootstrap image go here

## Darwin Setup

tl;dr: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AidanHilt/PersonalMonorepo/refs/heads/staging-cluster-k8s-work/nix/mono-flake/darwin-install.sh -o /tmp/installer && /tmp/installer`

For now, do NOT install determinate nix, it breaks... something, although I forget what.

More documentation to follow
